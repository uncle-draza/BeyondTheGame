=== Level 1 ===

(1.1)Listen to me very carefully! Do not move. They can see us if we move just as well we can see them. 
I told the same thing to the servants... But they didn't listen. They turned on the lights downstairs even after I warned them not to. I could hear their screams all the way up here.
Remember we are dealing with the hideous world in which we are practically helpless... So keep still.

(1.2)These monsters you can see above your head can see you only if you move. You are free to look around tho...

(1.3)Arent they magnificent? The creatures men call pure air and blue sky...

(1.4)Resonator, the machine before your very eyes allows us to see all of this...

=== Level 2 ===

(2.1)Not all of them are the same... These cannot see... They rely on hearing. Be quiet here...

(2.2) All of this you can see exists at the same place and at the same time we do... It is just... beyond our reach...

=== Level 3 ===
(3.1)These ones are different... They can sense even the slightest move... even your eyeballs moving...

(3.2)Do not even look around... Even I don't know what could happen to you... Probably the same thing that happened to the poor servants.


=== Level 4 ===
(4.1)It's not the creatures that made the servant scream so horribly... Do you see now? 

(4.2) I have drawn down demons from the stars! I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world.

(4.3) Space belongs to me! Do you hear?

(4.4) I always knew you are no scientist! Trembling in fear and anxiety before them...

(4.5) They are coming... Look! It's just over your left shoulder!
